<b>Background: Current validation of the ADOS:</b>
The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) has been the gold-standard for autism diagnosis for many years. However, this assessmentâ€™s algorithm items were initially validated on only 223 samples, and later revised based on a new validation set of 1,630 assessments, across Modules 1-3 (Gotham et al., 2007; Lord et al., 2000). The revised algorithms have since been validated on an independent sample of 1,282 assessments (Gotham et al., 2008).

Background: Open Science:
Open data sharing has the incredibly potential to improve our research productivity. With recent initiatives, researchers have become more and more enabled to conduct large-scale analyses by cultivating large datasets they could have never acquired on their own. These initiatives are driven by the ethical principle that the public has a right to access taxpayer-funded research.

Project Objectives:
We sought to validate ADOS algorithm items that capture core features of autism with a larger dataset, and take this opportunity to highlight the value of open science data sharing. We invite others to use our analyses as a blueprint for their own exploration of open-access ADOS data.
